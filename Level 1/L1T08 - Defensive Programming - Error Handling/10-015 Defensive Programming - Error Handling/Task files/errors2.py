# There are some errors in this program. Run the program, look at the error messages, and find and fix the errors.

# Assign the string "Lion" to the variable 'animal'.
animal = ("Lion")

# Assign the string "cub" to the variable 'animal_type'.
animal_type = ("cub")

# Assign the integer 16 to the variable 'number_of_teeth'.
number_of_teeth = 16

# Create a formatted string using placeholders for the variables.
# The corrected placeholders should have curly braces around them.
# The santance did not sound right to me so i swapped animal type around with number of teeth, so it can read correctly.
full_spec = (f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth")

# Print the full specification.
print (full_spec)
