# Data Science Bootcamp - Stellenbosch University x HyperionDev

# Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments completed during my Data Science Bootcamp at Stellenbosch University in partnership with HyperionDev. The bootcamp covered a broad range of topics, from Python programming and data visualization to machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

# Bootcamp Highlights
- Python for Data Science - Data types, control structures, functions
- Data Wrangling - Pandas, NumPy, Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Databases & SQL - Querying, data storage, and ETL processes
- Data Visualization - Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning - Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text processing, sentiment analysis
- Capstone Projects - End-to-end real-world data science applications

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three levels, corresponding to the bootcamp structure:

# Level 1 - Python & Programming Foundations
- L1T01 - L1T15 - Fundamentals of Python, control structures, error handling, data structures, and file operations.
- Key Project: Chatbot Project - A simple chatbot implementation using conditional statements and string operations.

# Level 2 - Data Science Fundamentals & Visualization
- L2T01 - L2T11 - Data sources, databases, SQL, data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistics.
- L2T06 - L2T08 - Data visualization using Power BI, Tableau, and Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Capstone Project: Linear Regression in Action - A predictive modeling project using regression techniques.

# Level 3 - Machine Learning & NLP
- L3T01 - L3T06 - Advanced machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering.
- Capstone Project: NLP Applications - Implemented natural language processing techniques for text classification tasks.
