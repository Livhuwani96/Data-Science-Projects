# Data Science Bootcamp - Stellenbosch University x HyperionDev

# Overview
This repository contains projects completed during my Data Science Bootcamp at Stellenbosch University in partnership with HyperionDev. The bootcamp covered a broad range of topics, from Python programming and data visualization to machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

# Bootcamp Highlights
- Python for Data Science - Data types, control structures, functions
- Data Wrangling - Pandas, NumPy, Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Databases & SQL - Querying, data storage, and ETL processes
- Data Visualization - Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning - Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text processing, sentiment analysis
- Capstone Projects - End-to-end real-world data science applications

# Key Projects

**Task Manager (Python File Handling & CLI App)**  
**Goal:** Developed a CLI-based task management system using Python and text file handling.  
**Tech Used:** Python (File I/O, Data Structures, Control Flow)  
**Features:**  
- User authentication (login system using `user.txt`)  
- Task assignment, tracking, and status updates (stored in `tasks.txt`)  
- Admin dashboard for user/task statistics
