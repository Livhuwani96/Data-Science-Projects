Answer here\n","\n","*Self-driving car:\n","Input: Images and sensor data from cameras and LIDAR sensors.\n","\n","Output: Steering angles, acceleration, and braking commands.\n","\n","Justification: The self-driving car uses the input data to understand its environment, including the position of other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and the road’s layout. The output controls the car’s actions to navigate safely.\n","\n","*Netflix recommendation system:\n","Input: User’s viewing history, ratings, search queries, and time spent on shows.\n","\n","Output: A list of recommended movies and TV shows.\n","\n","Justification: The recommendation system analyzes the input to discern patterns in the user’s preferences and suggests content that matches these preferences, aiming to enhance user engagement.\n","\n","*Signature recognition:\n","Input: An image of a handwritten signature.\n","\n","Output: A decision on whether the signature is genuine or forged.\n","\n","Justification: The system compares the input signature with a database of known signatures using feature extraction and pattern recognition to verify the signer’s identity.\n","\n","*Medical diagnosis:\n","Input: Patient symptoms, medical history, lab test results, and imaging data.\n","\n","Output: A list of possible diagnoses and recommended treatments.\n","\n","Justification: The diagnosis system uses the input data to identify patterns and correlations with known medical conditions, helping healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about patient care."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_I2f4C85yNF"},"source":["\n","2.

Classifying emails as promotional or social:\n","\n","Algorithm: Classification\n","Justification: The task involves categorizing emails into discrete classes (promotional or social), which is a typical classification problem.\n","* 2.2. Forecasting the stock price of a company:\n","\n","Algorithm: Regression\n","Justification: Stock price prediction requires estimating a continuous value (the price) based on historical data, making it a regression task.\n","* 2.3. Sorting images of animals into different species:\n","\n","Algorithm: Classification\n","Justification: This task involves assigning images to predefined categories (species), which is a classic example of a classification problem.\n","* 2.4. Predicting the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease:\n","\n","Algorithm: Classification or Regression\n","Justification: If the outcome is binary (disease or no disease), it’s a classification problem. However, if the task is to predict a probability score (likelihood), it could be approached as a regression problem that outputs continuous values between 0 and 1.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b6f8UETG64hH"},"source":["3.

Answer here\n","* 3.1.Approach: Unsupervised Learning\n","Justification: Since there’s no prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns, unsupervised learning is suitable for identifying unusual patterns or outliers in the data without labeled examples.\n","\n","* 3.2. Approach: Supervised Learning\n","Justification: This task involves using historical transaction data and customer demographics (labeled data) to predict a continuous value (lifetime value), which is a regression problem within supervised learning.\n","\n","* 3.3. Approach: Unsupervised Learning\n","Justification: The goal is to discover inherent groupings in the data (purchase history, browsing behaviour, and preferences) without predefined labels, making it a clustering problem, which is an unsupervised learning task.\n","\n","* 3.4. Approach: Supervised or Unsupervised Learning\n","Justification: If there are predefined themes and labeled examples of posts, supervised learning can be used.

Answer here\n","\n","* 4.1. Appropriateness: Possibly, but not necessary\n","Justification: If most transactions are labeled, a supervised learning algorithm could be sufficient. However, semi-supervised learning could be beneficial if there’s a significant amount of unlabeled data that can be leveraged to improve the model’s performance.\n","\n","* 4.2. Appropriateness: Yes\n","Justification: Semi-supervised learning is appropriate here because only a small portion of the data is labeled. The algorithm can use the labeled data to learn and then apply this knowledge to label the rest of the data.\n","\n","* 4.3. Appropriateness: Possibly, but not necessary\n","Justification: Similar to 4.1, if the majority of emails are labeled, supervised learning might be adequate. However, semi-supervised learning could be used to incorporate any unlabeled data to refine the model further.\n","\n","* 4.4. Appropriateness: No\n","Justification: Since the problem involves complete financial and credit-related information, it implies that the data is fully labeled.
